// Which of the game's menus are open, kept from the menu open/close events.
//
// Asking the UI with GetMenuOpen() copies a reference to the menu itself. Done every frame, sooner or later that
// copy is the last one when the game closes the menu, and the menu is then torn down on our thread instead of the
// UI's: the workshop menu's Scaleform pieces get freed under the UI, which crashes on the way out of build mode or
// leaves its icons on screen. These flags never touch the menus.
